- **Performance testing** with concurrent requests
- **Error handling validation**
- **100% core functionality test coverage**

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table with role-based access
users (user_id, role, alias, email, password_hash, created_at)

-- Classes with teacher-student relationships
classes (class_id, teacher_id, student_id, staff_id, start_time, end_time, meet_link, created_at)

-- Attendance tracking
attendance (attendance_id, class_id, user_id, punch_in, punch_out, created_at)
```

### API Endpoints (20+ endpoints)
- **Authentication**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/profile`
- **User Management**: `/users/*` (CRUD operations)
- **Class Management**: `/classes/*` (CRUD operations)
- **Attendance**: `/attendance/*` (punch in/out, reports)
- **Timetables**: `/classes/*/timetable` (role-specific views)

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Validation**: Joi schemas
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, Rate limiting
- **Testing**: Custom test suites with axios

## 🚀 System Capabilities

### Admin Role
- ✅ Create/manage all users (admin, staff, teacher, student)
- ✅ View comprehensive attendance logs with filters
- ✅ Access all system reports and analytics
- ✅ Full system administration capabilities

### Staff Role
- ✅ Assign teachers and students to classes
- ✅ Set class schedules with time validation
- ✅ Manage Google Meet links
- ✅ Cannot manage users (security boundary)

### Teacher Role
- ✅ View assigned timetable
- ✅ Punch in/out for each class
- ✅ Provide Google Meet links
- ✅ Access personal attendance records

### Student Role
- ✅ View personal timetable
- ✅ Punch in/out for classes
- ✅ Access Google Meet links (anonymized)
- ✅ View personal attendance statistics

## 📈 Performance & Scalability
